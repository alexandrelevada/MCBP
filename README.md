# Towards boundary points detection with mean curvature estimation for unsupervised learning

Boundary detection in multivariate data is crucial for tasks such as outlier identification, cluster analysis, data filtering, and visualization. Traditional methods often rely on density-based clustering, which can struggle with complex, non-linear, or high-dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel boundary detection framework that leverages mean curvature estimation to identify boundaries accurately. Our method, called \emph{Mean Curvature Boundary Points} (MCBP), combines topological and differential geometric properties, focusing on mean curvature to detect subtle changes in data distribution at boundary points. By analyzing local neighborhoods within the data using curvature analysis, the proposed approach improves boundary detection, even in complex or non-convex datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through synthetic and real-world datasets, showing its potential to enhance the robustness and interpretability of machine learning and pattern recognition models. Computational experiments indicate that in a number of datasets, the final clusters outperform the standard kmeans and the HDBSCAN clusters. Our findings support the claim that the proposed method may be a helpful instrument for unsupervised learning, more specifically, in data clustering issues. Overall, the method offers a promising solution for boundary detection in high-dimensional and non-linear datasets, contributing to more precise clustering and classification.
